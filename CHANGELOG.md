All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.11.3] - 2026-04-07

### Changed

- update and refine cli commands.
- Replaced missing `README.md` with multi-language versions (English and Chinese).
- Updated internal documentation links and project metadata.

### Fixed

- Stale repository links in `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- `extractTableData` now reads `affine:table` blocks stored with flat dot-notation Y.js keys (`prop:rows.{rowId}.order`, `prop:columns.{colId}.order`, `prop:cells.{rowId}:{colId}.text`) used by self-hosted AFFiNE instances. Previously `block.get("prop:rows")` returned `undefined` for this schema, causing all table exports to show empty tables with `had no readable cell data` warnings.
- `list_docs` now filters out deleted documents that briefly remain in GraphQL edges after workspace metadata has already dropped them.
- Completed the delete/list_docs hardening introduced in `v1.11.1` so the visible edge list, `totalCount`, and `endCursor` stay aligned after `delete_doc`.

### Tests

- Re-ran live delete/list regression coverage against Dockerized AFFiNE `0.26.4` with `tests/test-doc-discovery.mjs`.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- `list_docs` now clamps stale `totalCount` metadata after `delete_doc` removes a document but AFFiNE GraphQL still reports the pre-delete count.
- `list_docs.pageInfo.endCursor` now aligns with the last returned edge cursor after delete-driven metadata drift.

### Tests

- Added live regression coverage for delete/list count correction in `tests/test-doc-discovery.mjs`.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- `read_database_columns` to expose database schema metadata for empty or sparsely populated AFFiNE databases.
- Preset-backed `data_view` creation for kanban-oriented AFFiNE database views.
- Focused supporting-tools regression coverage via `npm run test:supporting-tools`.
- Markdown callout round-trips for admonition-style import/export flows.

### Changed

- `test:comprehensive` now self-bootstraps a local Docker AFFiNE stack and provides a raw mode for pre-provisioned environments.
- `test:e2e` now isolates Docker stacks per run and seeds data-view state before Playwright verification.
- README release history was trimmed in favor of dedicated changelog and release-note sources.

### Fixed

- Empty database workflows no longer depend on existing rows to discover column names, IDs, types, and view mappings.
- Reduced Docker bootstrap flakiness in the E2E pipeline by isolating Compose projects and staging startup checks.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Tag visibility regression coverage in Docker E2E:
    - MCP setup scenario: `tests/test-tag-visibility.mjs`
    - Playwright UI verification: `tests/playwright/verify-tag-visibility.pw.ts`
- Docker E2E credential bootstrap retry controls:
    - `AFFINE_HEALTH_MAX_RETRIES`
    - `AFFINE_HEALTH_INTERVAL_MS`
    - `AFFINE_CREDENTIAL_ACQUIRE_RETRIES`
    - `AFFINE_CREDENTIAL_RETRY_DELAY_SECONDS`

### Changed

- Tag persistence now aligns with AFFiNE tag option schema by storing canonical tag option IDs and normalizing legacy tag entries.
- Tag-facing tool outputs now resolve option IDs back to labels for stable UX parity (`read_doc`, `list_docs`, `list_tags`, `list_docs_by_tag`, markdown export).
- Docker E2E credential bootstrap now emits health-check configuration and retries credential acquisition before failing.

### Fixed

- Resolved issue where tags persisted via MCP were not visible in the AFFiNE UI.
- Reduced CI flakiness from transient AFFiNE container startup timing by adding retry and on-failure Docker diagnostics.

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- MCP-created document block hierarchy now follows AFFiNE UI parity by writing `sys:parent` as `null` and relying on `sys:children` relationships.
- Placement resolution for `append_block` (`beforeBlockId` / `afterBlockId`) now resolves parent context from child links when `sys:parent` is null.
- Workspace bootstrap document blocks were aligned to the same null-parent shape for consistency.

### Fixed

- Resolved UI invisibility/inconsistency risk for MCP-created docs caused by parent linkage mismatch versus UI-created docs.
- Fixed callout rendering parity by creating/storing callout text in a child paragraph block so text is visible in AFFiNE UI.
- Added regression assertions in Docker E2E scripts to verify null-parent structure after `create_doc`, `append_paragraph`, and `create_doc_from_markdown`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Optional HTTP deployment mode with Streamable HTTP endpoint `/mcp` and backward-compatible legacy endpoints (`/sse`, `/messages`) for remote MCP clients.
- New `start:http` npm script (`MCP_TRANSPORT=http node dist/index.js`) for one-command HTTP mode startup.
- HTTP runtime dependencies and typings for remote hosting (`express`, `cors`, `@types/express`, `@types/cors`).

### Changed

- `MCP_TRANSPORT` now supports `stdio` (default), `http`/`streamable`, and legacy alias `sse`.
- Added HTTP deployment environment controls: `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_HOST`, `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `AFFINE_MCP_HTTP_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS`.
- WebSocket ack flow was simplified with shared timeout/error handling utilities.
- Workspace bootstrap now propagates the optional `avatar` argument into initial workspace metadata.
- README and remote deployment guidance expanded with security defaults and hosting presets.

### Fixed

- `/mcp` now consistently applies the 50MB JSON parser for large MCP payloads.
- HTTP bearer authentication now accepts case-insensitive scheme variants (`Bearer` / `bearer`).
- Removed dead config/type scaffolding and tightened internal config parsing for header JSON.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- 11 new document workflow tools: `list_tags`, `list_docs_by_tag`, `create_tag`, `add_tag_to_doc`, `remove_tag_from_doc`, `export_doc_markdown`, `create_doc_from_markdown`, `append_markdown`, `replace_doc_with_markdown`, `add_database_column`, `add_database_row`.
- Interactive CLI subcommands: `affine-mcp login`, `affine-mcp status`, `affine-mcp logout`.
- End-to-end verification pipeline with Docker and Playwright (`tests/run-e2e.sh`, `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).
- New npm test commands: `test:e2e`, `test:db-create`, `test:bearer`, `test:playwright`.

### Changed

- Tool surface expanded from 32 to 43 canonical tools.
- Runtime server version now resolves from `package.json` through `src/config.ts` (`VERSION`) and is reused by runtime/CLI user-agent headers.
- Authentication/bootstrap flow supports config-file fallback (`~/.config/affine-mcp/config`) and Bearer headers across GraphQL/WebSocket paths.
- `list_docs` now enriches each document node with tags from workspace metadata snapshots.
- Added markdown and E2E test dependencies in package metadata (`markdown-it`, `@types/markdown-it`, `@playwright/test`).
- `workspaces` and `blobStorage` tools now use typed `graphqlClient` accessors and shared bearer/cookie propagation.
- `test-comprehensive.mjs` now asserts tag workflows and markdown roundtrip workflows.

### Fixed

- Hardened GraphQL/auth error handling for redirects, non-JSON responses, and timeout boundaries.
- Added CR/LF guardrails for cookie/header handling to prevent header-injection edge cases.
- Added `.gitignore` rules for generated E2E and Playwright artifacts.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- `append_block` Step4 types: `database`, `data_view`, `surface_ref`, `frame`, `edgeless_text`, `note`.
- Local integration coverage for all append profiles (`step1`..`step4`) in `scripts/test-append-block-expansion.mjs`.

### Changed

- `append_block` canonical type set expanded to 30 verified cases with stricter field validation and parent-container checks.
- Step4 creation payloads now use Yjs-native value types (`Y.Map`/`Y.Array`) to avoid runtime serialization failures.

### Fixed

- Resolved `Unexpected content type` failures while appending database/edgeless blocks.
- Aligned `surface_ref` caption validation with block creation behavior.
- Prevented AFFiNE UI runtime crashes from `type=data_view` by mapping it to stable `affine:database` output.

### Fixed

- Runtime MCP server metadata version in `src/index.ts` updated to `1.4.0`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added

- Open-source community health files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`.
- GitHub community templates: bug/feature issue templates and PR template.
- CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and Dependabot config.
- Tool manifest (`tool-manifest.json`) and static verification script (`npm run test:tool-manifest`).

### Changed

- Tool surface simplified to 31 canonical tools with no duplicated alias names.
- Comprehensive integration test script now validates runtime tool list against `tool-manifest.json`.
- Package metadata improved (`bugs`, `homepage`) and new quality scripts (`npm run ci`, `npm run pack:check`).

### Removed

- Duplicated alias tools (`affine_*`) and low-value/unstable tools from default surface.
- Deprecated `src/tools/updates.ts` and legacy workspace fixed alias tooling.

## [1.2.2] - 2025-09-18

### Fixed

- CLI binary now runs through Node via `bin/affine-mcp`, preventing shells from misinterpreting ESM JS files and avoiding false startup timeouts.
