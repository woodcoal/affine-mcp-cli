# Release Notes

## Version 1.11.2 (2026-03-31)

### Highlights

- Corrected stale `list_docs` edge results so deleted documents no longer linger after `delete_doc`.
- Completed the delete/list_docs hardening started in `v1.11.1` by keeping the visible edge list aligned with workspace metadata.
- Revalidated the delete/list workflow live against AFFiNE `0.26.4`.

### What Changed

- `src/tools/docs.ts`
    - Filter out deleted documents that remain in GraphQL edges after the workspace snapshot has already dropped them.
    - Keep the visible edge list aligned with the corrected `totalCount` and `endCursor` metadata after delete-driven drift.
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tool-manifest.json`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
    - Bumped release metadata to `1.11.2`.
    - Refreshed release-facing docs for the follow-up patch release.

### Validation Evidence

- Release sanity gate passed:
    - `npm run ci`

### What Changed

- `src/tools/docs.ts`
    - Clamp `list_docs.totalCount` downward when the workspace snapshot shows fewer pages than GraphQL reports after a deletion.
    - Align `pageInfo.endCursor` with the last returned edge cursor and recompute offset-based `hasNextPage` when the count is clamped.
- `tests/test-doc-discovery.mjs`

    - Added backward-compatible normalization for legacy string tag entries.
    - Added tag label resolution for tag-facing outputs (`read_doc`, `list_docs`, `list_tags`, `list_docs_by_tag`, markdown export).
- `tests/test-tag-visibility.mjs`, `tests/playwright/verify-tag-visibility.pw.ts`

### What Changed

- Docs: `.env` usage removed; prefer environment variables via shell or app config (Codex/Claude config examples updated).
- Maintains 1.2.1 behavior: email/password login is asynchronous by default.

### Usage Snippets

- Codex (global install):
    - `npm i -g affine-mcp-server`
    - `codex mcp add affine --env AFFINE_BASE_URL=https://your-affine-instance.com --env 'AFFINE_EMAIL=you@example.com' --env 'AFFINE_PASSWORD=secret!' -- affine-mcp`
- Codex (npx):
    - `codex mcp add affine --env AFFINE_BASE_URL=https://your-affine-instance.com --env 'AFFINE_EMAIL=you@example.com' --env 'AFFINE_PASSWORD=secret!' -- npx -y -p affine-mcp-server affine-mcp`
- Claude Desktop:
    - `{"mcpServers":{"affine":{"command":"affine-mcp","env":{"AFFINE_BASE_URL":"https://...","AFFINE_EMAIL":"you@example.com","AFFINE_PASSWORD":"secret!"}}}}`

---

## Version 1.2.1 (2025-09-17)

- New env toggle: set `AFFINE_LOGIN_AT_START=sync` only when startup must block.
- Documentation overhaul for Codex and Claude with npm, npx, and local clone usage.

### What Changed

- Startup auth flow no longer blocks MCP initialization; handshake happens immediately.
- Cleaned up repository artifacts not needed for distribution.

### Usage Snippets

- Codex (global install):
    - `npm i -g affine-mcp-server`
    - `codex mcp add affine --env AFFINE_BASE_URL=https://your-affine-instance.com --env 'AFFINE_EMAIL=you@example.com' --env 'AFFINE_PASSWORD=secret!' -- affine-mcp`
- Codex (npx):
    - `codex mcp add affine --env AFFINE_BASE_URL=https://your-affine-instance.com --env 'AFFINE_EMAIL=you@example.com' --env 'AFFINE_PASSWORD=secret!' -- npx -y -p affine-mcp-server affine-mcp`
- Claude Desktop:
    - `{"mcpServers":{"affine":{"command":"affine-mcp","env":{"AFFINE_BASE_URL":"https://...","AFFINE_EMAIL":"you@example.com","AFFINE_PASSWORD":"secret!"}}}}`

---

## Version 1.2.0 (2025-09-16) 🚀

### 🎉 Highlights

- Document creation, editing, and deletion via WebSocket updates
- One-line install + run from npm: `npm i -g affine-mcp-server` → `affine-mcp`

### ✨ What's New

- `create_doc` – create a new doc (page/surface/note/paragraph minimal structure)
- `append_paragraph` – append a paragraph block (simple editing example)
- `delete_doc` – delete a doc and remove it from workspace list
- Supports both prefixed/non-prefixed tool names (`affine_*` and non-prefixed)

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- Applied NodeNext ESM resolution (stabilized relative `.js` imports)
- Improved SDK type consistency with MCP response format utilities
- Provided `bin`: `affine-mcp` (stdio only)

### 🧰 Usage (Claude / Codex)

- Claude Desktop: `command: "affine-mcp"`, `env: { AFFINE_* }`
- Codex: register MCP as a command (`affine-mcp`) and pass env (`AFFINE_*`)

### ⚠️ Notes

- Document editing syncs via WebSocket (`space:*`) events, not GraphQL
